	<h5>The Argentine Creole locro is a dish made from white corn, beans and squash or pumpkin. It requires a long cooking time, so it allows the use of tough cuts of meat such as brisket and it allows for different versions by varying the ingredients. <p>It has its origins in the time of the Spanish conquest of America and a rich tradition that reflects the fusion of both cultures.

		<li>300 grams of flour 0000</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
		<li>100 cubic centimeters of water</li>
		<li>50 grams of butter</li>
		<li>2 egg yolks</li>
		<li>2 teaspoons of ethyl alcohol</li>
	</ul>

		<li>240 grams of sugar</li>
		<li>100 cubic centimeters of water</li>
		<li>120 grams of egg whites (approx 4 units)</li>
	</ul>

	<strong>Steps: </strong>
	<ol>
		<li>Start by preparing the dough for your Rogel cake. To do this, make a crown with the flour on a clean counter. In the center, pour the water, melted butter, salt and alcohol. Integrate all the ingredients from the center out to obtain a smooth dough.</li>
		<li>Cover the dough and let it rest for about 20 minutes.</li>
		<li>After that time, cut the dough into 8 equal parts.</li>
		<li>Stretch each part as thin as you can between two sheets of plastic wrap or dividers.</li>
		<li>Take them to a non-stick oven plate or a stream with butter and flour. Prick them and cook them in an oven at 180ºC for about 10-12 minutes, until golden brown.</li>
		<li>Spread 1 of them with the pastry dulce de leche along with the traditional one, mix them. Overlay another dough and spread it too. Repeat this procedure until you reach the last mass, leave the latter without spreading.</li>
		<li>On the other hand, prepare the Italian meringue. To do this, heat the sugar with the water, it must cover the sugar. Pour the water slowly so that the sugar does not rise to the edges of the pot. Heat in a saucepan over medium heat until it reaches 118 ºC while you beat the egg whites until stiff. The Rogel cake recipe is almost ready!</li>
		<li>Pour the syrup in the form of a thread over the egg whites and beat until the container is at room temperature, the shiny meringue is held in the container.</li>
		<li>Cover the surface of the Rogel cake with the Italian meringue and enjoy this delicacy. You can brown the meringue with a torch or by taking it to the oven. You could also decorate it with melted chocolate strings, colored sprinkles, or edible pearls.</li>
